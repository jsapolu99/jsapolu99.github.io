## Introduction

The use of AI by students is seen by many as “cheating” due to its ability to produce answers for most if not all educational material. In reality AI is simply a new tool for students to use to further their education, especially in the case of Software Engineering. Calculators, like AI, were once seen by teachers as a tool that would disrupt a student's education. Today the use of calculators is the standard and its use is mandated on many tests. Though the use of AI is looked down upon by Universities, it will undoubtedly become an essential part of education in the near future.

My instructors this semester have been gracious enough to allow the use of AI for their courses, though obviously within reason (hence why I am writing this essay). Through my use of Open AI’s chatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot in combination with the lessons of my instructor, in a matter of months I have been able to learn many concepts of web development. There were many times where I was confused about how to implement a given concept, and rather than scouring through documentation for hours, I was able to find answers to many of my questions instantly via my use of AI. 

## Personal Experience with AI
Here are some examples of how I have used AI in ICS 314 thus far:

### Experience WODs
Experience WODs are essentially timed homework in which you create a small program based on the provided instructions. I used AI on many of these, one in particular being E31: BrowserHistory2. In the experience I was required to add CSS styles to a HTML file, Upon creating the style.css file GitHub Copilot automatically provided me with some standard css definitions. While attempting to alter them to better fit the assignments requirements, Copilot also generated exactly what I had intended to do, this saved me a lot of time to double check everything and allowed me to finish the WOD well within the allotted time.

### In-class Practice WODs
In-class Practice WODs work exactly the same as the Experience WODs except they are not graded and are completed in person with only one attempt allowed. At first I attempted these without using AI, but eventually found their use to be crucial. Though they did not affect my grade in the class, I found that practicing what prompts to use in chatGPT to produce what I was looking for to be very helpful, especially when it came time to do the graded in-class WODs. 

### In-class WODs
For the In-class WODs I took very little chances, relying on chatGPT the second I found myself not knowing what to do next. A perfect example of this were any of the WODs pertaining to Javascript’s underscore library. I really struggled to understand which function to use for a given task. My solution was asking chatGPT: “Using the underscore library do <insert task to be done>” , and in seconds it provided me with code that did exactly what the WOD asked. Admittedly my personal knowledge of the underscore library at the time was not sufficient to pass. However, through chatGPTs explanation (and further research) I was able to develop a good understanding of the concepts. 

### Essays
While I have never used AI to explicitly write an essay for me. I have asked chatGPT to generate an outline of an essay based on a given topic. I then found credible sources and wrote my essay by more or less following the structure of the AI generated outline. I believe this is an ethical way of using AI to assist in the writing process as it simply provides you with a launching off point for writing one's own essay. 

### Final project
For my group's final project we created an AI chat-bot that answers UH specific information technology service (ITS) related questions based on articles from the UH ITS FAQ. This required us to work with OpenAI’s API, as well as the vector database platform Pinecone. Initially knowing nothing about how to work with either of these I asked chatGPT for information. Surprisingly it provided very little knowledge as many of the frameworks and services were created/updated after chatGPT’s cut off date of January 2022. Thus I was forced to dig through OpenAI’s documentation to figure out many of the problems I was running into. 
 
### Learning a concept / tutorial
In another of my classes ICS 390 I am an ATA of an ICS 211 lab. I often mind self needing a refresher on many of the courses concepts such as binary search trees or heaps. With chatGPT I can simply write a prompt such as “What is a binary search tree?” or “Create a binary search tree in Java”, and am provided with a concise breakdown of the concept as well as how to implement it. This has proven very helpful and I often recommend the students to ask chatGPT similar questions if they are still struggling. 

### Answering a question in class or in Discord
I have never used AI to answer a question in class or in Discord simply because I have never answered a question I did not already know the answer to. I am sure chatGPT is very useful in answering these questions as I often ask the AI questions myself. However I feel if I had to ask chatGPT for the answer I likely don't have the proper knowledge to effectively answer the question. 

### Asking or answering a smart-question
I have also never used AI to answer a smart-question posted in the discord channel simply because I assume the poster has already attempted to ask chatGPT their question before asking. Thinking about it now, it would have been smarter to double check this before looking into their problems based on some of the “smart” questions people have asked. 

### Coding example 
Referring to the Learning a concept / tutorial section of this essay where I asked chatGPT to “Create a binary search tree in Java”. The AI returned the following:
```
class Node {
    int key;
    Node left, right;

    public Node(int item) {
        key = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

public class BinarySearchTree {
    Node root;

    public BinarySearchTree() {
        root = null;
    }

    // Insert a key into the BST
    public void insert(int key) {
        root = insertRec(root, key);
    }

    // A recursive function to insert a key into BST
    private Node insertRec(Node root, int key) {
        // If the tree is empty, create a new node
        if (root == null) {
            root = new Node(key);
            return root;
        }

        // Otherwise, recur down the tree
        if (key < root.key)
            root.left = insertRec(root.left, key);
        else if (key > root.key)
            root.right = insertRec(root.right, key);

        // Return the (unchanged) node pointer
        return root;
    }

    // Inorder traversal of the BST
    public void inorder() {
        inorderRec(root);
    }

    // A utility function to do inorder traversal of BST
    private void inorderRec(Node root) {
        if (root != null) {
            inorderRec(root.left);
            System.out.print(root.key + " ");
            inorderRec(root.right);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinarySearchTree tree = new BinarySearchTree();

        // Insert keys
        tree.insert(50);
        tree.insert(30);
        tree.insert(20);
        tree.insert(40);
        tree.insert(70);
        tree.insert(60);
        tree.insert(80);

        // Print inorder traversal
        System.out.println("Inorder traversal:");
        tree.inorder();
    }
}

```
As you can see chatGPT provides an excellent implementation of a binary search tree with comments that explain what each section of code does. 

### Explaining code
Writing code
Documenting code
Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
