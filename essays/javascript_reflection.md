## My experience with Javascript
As a complete beginner to Javascript, I had no clue what I was in for. I had learned new languages like C and C++ rather quickly and assumed Javascript would be no different. Thankfully, I was completely correct. Javascript is an amazingly simple yet complex language that I dare say has become my favorite thus far. In comparison to Java and C, it is far easier and less time consuming to create practically everything. Unlike in C, functions don’t need header files to be included in other files. Simply write and export and import statement and it’s all ready to go. With Java, creating objects can be a real hassle, but with Javascript it's almost as simple as tieing my shoes. Furthermore, Javascript is widely used in web development, so learning was an absolute must if I ever wanted to explore a possible career in the field. Overall, I have quickly fallen in love with Javascript and plan to use it to create many projects to come. 

## Coding Trials
Athletic software engineering reminds me of the coding portions of previous exams I have taken. Sure it can be stressful when the clock is counting down and you just can’t figure the problem out, but it’s in those moments that we are forced to think critically and fast, allowing for feelings of pride in our abilities, or a cause for reflection of our weaknesses. Overall, I think it is a great way of learning that is both a mixture of fun and stress. Though the stress is greatly reduced with the practice WODS which are very helpful. 

## Final Thoughts
While I'd like to think I currently have a fair bit of programming knowledge, I know there is much more out there that I do not yet know, but this it what drives me to keep learning. Before this class, I had no idea what to expect of learning Javascript, but now after only one week, I have a at minimum surface level understanding of how it works. Additionally, the pressure of having to complete the WODs under a certain time pushes my urge to learn even further. I am very excited to see what this course has in store for me, and even more excited to see the programmer I become.
