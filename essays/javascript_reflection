As a complete beginner to Javascript, I had no clue what I was in for. I had learned new languages like C and C++ rather quickly and assumed Javascript would be no different. Thankfully I was completely correct, Javascript is an amazingly simple yet complex language that I dare say has become my favorite thus far. In comparison to Java and C, it is far easier and less time consuming to create practically everything. Unlike in C functions don’t need header files to be included in other files. Simply write and export and import statement and it’s all ready to go. With Java creating objects can be a real hassle, but with Javascript it's almost as simple as tieing my shoes. Furthermore Javascript is widely used in web development so learning was an absolute must if I ever wanted to explore a possible career in the field. Overall I have quickly fallen in love with Javascript, and plan to use it to create many projects to come. 

Athletic software engineering reminds me of the coding portions of previous exams I have taken. Sure it can be stressful when the clock is counting down and you just can’t figure the problem out. But it’s in those moments that we are forced to think critically and fast, allowing for feelings of pride in our abilities, or a cause for reflection of our weaknesses. Overall I think it is a great way of learning that is both a mixture of fun and stress. Though the stress is greatly reduced with the practice WODS which are very helpful.
