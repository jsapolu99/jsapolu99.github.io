## Introduction
In the realm of software engineering, we often find ourselves in situations where our code is not working properly. After spending hours trying to figure it out to no avail, many software engineers turn to community forums such as StackOverflow, in hopes that someone graciously helps them with their problem. But just like answers from the community, not all questions are of the same quality. Having read Eric Steven Raymond’s essay [“How to Ask Questions the Smart Way”] (http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), I have learned what makes a question worth answering. It is the goal of this essay to share Raymond’s teachings by providing two examples: a bad question, and a good question, and analyzing what makes one far superior to the other. 

## Good Question
### MapboxGL won't work in NodeJS production environment, but works in development

This user’s question is a rather good example of how to ask a smart question. The subject field of this question is concise and informs readers of the problem at hand. In the body of this question, the author explains the steps he took to try and solve the problem before posting, including searching for related posts and providing their links. Also in the post are snippets of plain text of the user’s code, as well as the errors that were thrown. 

All in all this question provides respondents with exactly what they need to potentially solve the problem. Furthermore the author’s inclusion of his previous efforts give respect to respondents' time, proving to them that this is a question worthy of receiving an answer.

## Bad Question
### “I’m new to coding sorry if its a dumb question. But how do I make it so it shows only the third option in an If Else ”

This is undoubtedly a horrible question. Simply by reading the subject it is clear to the community that this person put no effort into figuring out their issue, before running to the forum to ask for help. Openly admitting his question is dumb, and expecting the community to have pity on him, and give him the answer. 

Additionally rather than posting their code in plain text, they link an image of their screen. This makes it impossible for potential respondents to copy and paste the code into their IDEs, making it impossible for them to easily replicate the problem and find a solution. The poster of this question never received the answer they wanted. In fact they were scolded by other users for the poor state of the post, one respondent going as far as to send them a link to a similar “how to ask a good question” essay. The post is now closed and will not receive any further answers.

## Conclusion
Communities like stack overflow rely on unpaid users to help one another. The least someone can do is put a little effort into how exactly they ask for help, as no one wants to waste their time on a simple question that could easily be googled, or a question that provides little to know information as to how the error occurred. It is imperative that we remember these people do not get paid to answer our questions, they do it out of the kindness of their hearts, and therefore should be given the respect they deserve.
