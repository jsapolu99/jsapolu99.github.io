# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to improve the searching effectiveness of the University of Hawaii’s Ask Us search engine, which takes in user queries and attempts to return a list of IT-related articles that may help the users resolve their IT issues. Our group tryRebooting, implemented an AI search engine designed to alleviate the need to contact the IT help desk representative.

We wanted this AI search engine to be able to respond to queries as helpfully as possible for anyone with a specific question, or even a general topic to a question. This means being able to ask follow-up questions to unclear queries and being conversational.

All users have acssess to the interface at the landing page, but we also provided login capabilities in order for the AI to be able to store previous chat sessions(WIP). This includes “admin” accounts that have access to our “Analytics” page that helps to show the most popular articles used as references to form a response.
